## Mentorship 

### [Graduate Applications International Network (GAIN) Mentorship Program](https://gain-network.net/mentors) (June 2023 - present)
Mentoring student from Ghana applying to Masters program in Economics in the US, Canada, and Switzerland. Provide support editing student's personal statement and CV and deciding which programs to apply to. 

### Mentorship Program with University of Global Health Equity in Kigali, Rwanda (Feb 2021 - June 2022)
Participated in mentorship program between Duke University medical students and the new [University of Global Health Equity (UGHE) Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery program](https://ughe.org/academics/bachelor-medicine-bachelor-surgery) in Rwanda. I met monthly with my UGHE mentee to provide advice, tips, and moral support, a role typically filled by upper-year students which UGHE lacked at the time.  

### Holton Wellness Clinic Student Opportunity, Duke School of Medicine (Sept 2019 - Dec 2021)
Was on the leadership team and served as an MS3+ mentor for the Holton Clinic Elective, which provides first-year medical students with early clinical exposure under the guidance of an upper-year student and clinical provider. I supervised first-year students twice monthly in clinic. I also organized and led monthly teaching sessions on common clinical presentations and health disparities.
