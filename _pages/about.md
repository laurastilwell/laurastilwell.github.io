I am an MD/PhD in Public Policy at Duke University, [Sanford School of Public Policy](https://sanford.duke.edu/) and [Duke School of Medicine](https://medschool.duke.edu/education/health-professions-education-programs/medical-scientist-training-program-mdphd). I expect to graduate in May 2025 and plan to pursue a residency in Pediatrics. 

My research straddles the areas of public health and social policy. I examine how policies and interventions impact children's and families' well-being, especially low-income families and vulnerable pediatric patient populations.  

My work has been published in *Academic Pediatrics*, *The Journal of Pediatrics*, *Child Maltreatment*, and *Child Abuse & Neglect*. I have forthcoming work in *Social Service Review* and the *Journal of Public Policy Analysis and Management.*
