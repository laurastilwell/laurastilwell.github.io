I am an MD/PhD in Public Policy at Duke University, [Sanford School of Public Policy](https://sanford.duke.edu/) and [Duke School of Medicine](https://medschool.duke.edu/education/health-professions-education-programs/medical-scientist-training-program-mdphd). I expect to graduate in May 2025 and plan to pursue a residency in Pediatrics. 

My research straddles the areas of public health and social policy. I examine how policies and interventions impact children's and families' well-being, especially low-income families and vulnerable pediatric patient populations.  

As MD/Phd situated centrally in population health, with a specific lens on economic resources during children’s sensitive earliest years of development (starting at birth/prenatally?).  focused on two angles:  risk minimization of really bad health outcomes like child maltreatment; and optimization of investments that support children’s thriving and flourishing.  Collectively about social determinants of health, and children’s early health trajectories.


My work has been published in Academic Pediatrics, Child Maltreatment,
