I am an MD/PhD in Public Policy at Duke University, [Sanford School of Public Policy](https://sanford.duke.edu/) and [Duke School of Medicine](https://medschool.duke.edu/education/health-professions-education-programs/medical-scientist-training-program-mdphd). I expect to graduate in May 2025 and plan to pursue a residency in Pediatrics. 

My research straddles the areas of public health and social policy. I examine how policies and interventions impact children's and families' well-being, especially low-income families and vulnerable pediatric patient populations.   

My work has been published in *Academic Pediatrics*, *The Journal of Pediatrics*, *Child Maltreatment*, and *Child Abuse & Neglect*. I have forthcoming publications in *Social Service Review* and the *Journal of Public Policy Analysis and Management.* My research has been supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development of the NIH ([F30HD108866](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Pn6pRkq-AkKaxBqAYDvdZA/project-details/10678527)),  Duke University Katherine Goodman Stern Fellowship, [Social Science Research Council's Charles E. Lindblom Memorial Fellowship](https://www.ssrc.org/news/2022/04/28/laura-stilwell-of-duke-university-awarded-2022-charles-e-lindblom-memorial-fellowship/), [P.E.O Scholar Award](https://www.peointernational.org/peo-scholar-awards), among others.
