I am in my final year of of Duke's MD/PhD program. I defended my PhD in Public Policy (Economics concentration) at [Sanford School of Public Policy](https://sanford.duke.edu/) in April 2024 and am in my 4th year of medical school at [Duke School of Medicine](https://medschool.duke.edu/education/health-professions-education-programs/medical-scientist-training-program-mdphd). I will graduate in May 2025 and plan to pursue a research-track residency in Pediatrics. 

My research combines insights from economics, public health, and clinical medicine to examine how policies and interventions impact children's and families' well-being. Motivated by the goal to reduce socioeconomic disparities in health and development outcomes for children in the US and abroad, my research focuses on low-income families, families and children from low-resource settings, and vulnerable pediatric patient populations. I use a variety of methods in my work, including descriptive analyses, quasi-experimental, and experimental econometric techniques. I have worked on several large-scale randomized control trials, including an ongoing study in Pakistan.  

My work has been published in *Academic Pediatrics*, *The Journal of Pediatrics*, *Child Maltreatment*, *Child Abuse & Neglect*, the *Journal of Public Policy Analysis and Management*, and *Social Service Review*. My research has been supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development of the NIH ([F30HD108866](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/Pn6pRkq-AkKaxBqAYDvdZA/project-details/10678527)),  Duke University Katherine Goodman Stern Fellowship, [Social Science Research Council's Charles E. Lindblom Memorial Fellowship](https://www.ssrc.org/news/2022/04/28/laura-stilwell-of-duke-university-awarded-2022-charles-e-lindblom-memorial-fellowship/), [P.E.O. Scholar Award](https://www.peointernational.org/peo-scholar-awards), among others. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a research assistant at the [Jameel Poverty Action Lab](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/) in Cambridge, MA, primarily contributing to projects in India. I graduated from MIT in 2014 with a BS in Economics. 

I enjoy mentoring students who are interested in combining a social science degree with medicine. I have offered guidance and feedback to several students applying for MD/PhDs in the social sciences. If you are interested in an MD/PhD in the social sciences, please feel free to reach out if I can be of assistance.
